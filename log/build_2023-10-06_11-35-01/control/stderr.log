[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (PkgConfig)
  does not match the name of the calling package (gazebo).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:99 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/gazebo/gazebo-config.cmake:72 (include)

[33mCMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindREQUIRED.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "REQUIRED",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "REQUIRED" with any
  of the following names:

    REQUIREDConfig.cmake
    required-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "REQUIRED" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "REQUIRED_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "REQUIRED" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
