[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (PkgConfig)
  does not match the name of the calling package (gazebo).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):

  By not providing "Findaubo_ros2_common.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "aubo_ros2_common", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "aubo_ros2_common"
  with any of the following names:

    aubo_ros2_commonConfig.cmake
    aubo_ros2_common-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "aubo_ros2_common" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "aubo_ros2_common_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "aubo_ros2_common" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
