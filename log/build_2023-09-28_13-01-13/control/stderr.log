[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (PkgConfig)
  does not match the name of the calling package (gazebo).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):

[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgazebo_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "gazebo_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gazebo_msgs" with
  any of the following names:

    gazebo_msgsConfig.cmake
    gazebo_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gazebo_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gazebo_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "gazebo_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
